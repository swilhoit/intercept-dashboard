---

## Week 2: Strategic Optimizations
**Goal:** Harvest keywords, refine campaigns, improve structure

2. Set date range: Last 30 days
3. Filter by: Campaign name contains "Auto" or targeting type = "Auto"
4. Download report to Excel/Sheets
```

#### Step 2: Identify Converting Search Terms

**Criteria for Good Keywords:**
- ≥2 conversions in 30 days
- ACOS <25% (or ROAS >4.0x)
- ≥10 clicks

**Excel Formula to Filter:**
```
1. Sort by "Orders" column (descending)
2. Filter: Orders ≥ 2
3. Calculate ACOS: =(Spend / Sales) * 100
4. Filter: ACOS < 25%
5. Filter: Clicks ≥ 10
```

**Expected to Find:** 10-20 converting search terms

#### Step 3: Add High-Performing Search Terms as Keywords

**For Each Qualifying Search Term:**

```
1. Go to: Campaign → Keywords tab
2. Click: "Add keywords"
3. Enter the search term as:
   - EXACT match: [search term]
   - PHRASE match: "search term"
   - BROAD match: +search +term
4. Set initial bid: Same as Auto campaign or 10% lower
5. Add to relevant ad group
6. Add note: "Harvested from Auto - X conversions"
```

**Prioritize Adding:**
- Any term with ≥5 conversions → Add as EXACT
- Any term with ≥3 conversions → Add as PHRASE

2. Sort by: Clicks (descending)
3. Filter: Orders = 0
4. Filter: Clicks ≥ 5
```

**Identify for Negative Addition:**
- **Definitely Add:** ≥10 clicks, 0 conversions, high spend
- **Consider Adding:** Low relevance to products, wrong intent
- **Don't Add:** Low volume (<5 clicks), might convert later

**Common Negative Keyword Categories:**
- Generic/broad terms: "fireplace" alone (too broad)
- Wrong product type: "electric fireplace" (if you only sell glass doors)
- Research queries: "how to", "reviews", "compare"
- Low-intent: "cheap", "free", "ideas"

#### Step 2: Add Negative Keywords

**Campaign-Level Negatives:**

2. Click: "Add negative keywords"

4. Select match type:

- "cheap" [BROAD negative]
- Product types you don't sell [EXACT negatives]

**For Top 5 Converting Keywords:**

**Example: "3 inch paint rollers"**

```
1. Navigate to existing campaign or create new
2. Campaign name: "Paint Rollers - 3 Inch - EXACT"
3. Create new ad group: "3 inch paint rollers - EXACT"
4. Add single keyword: [3 inch paint rollers] - EXACT match only
5. Set bid: Current bid + 20%
6. Create tight ad copy focused on "3 inch paint rollers"
7. Use product-specific landing page
```

**Benefits of SKAGs:**

   - CPA = Spend / Conversions
   - ACOS = (Spend / Sales) * 100
```

#### Step 2: Bid Adjustment Rules

**Increase Bids (+20-30%):**
- High CVR (>8%) + Low impression share (<70%)
- High ROAS (>10x) + Spending full budget
- High CTR (>2%) + Profitable CPA

**Decrease Bids (-20-30%):**
- Low CVR (<3%) + High CPA (>$10)
- Low CTR (<0.5%)
- ROAS <5x

**Pause Keywords:**
- $50+ spend with 0 conversions
- ROAS <2.0x after $100+ spend
- CTR <0.3% after 1000+ impressions

**Implementation:**
```
1. Sort Excel by ROAS (descending)
2. Top 20% high ROAS: Increase bids 25%
3. Bottom 20% low ROAS: Decrease bids 25% or pause
4. Make changes in Amazon Ads console
5. Add notes explaining each change
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] Reviewed all keywords with >$20 spend

## Emergency Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

**Immediate Rollback Triggers:**
- ROAS drops below 8.0x for 3+ consecutive days
- Daily spend exceeds $175 without corresponding sales
- Cost per conversion exceeds $12 for 3+ days
- Major stockout affecting top products
- Conversion rate drops >30% (listing issue?)

---

### Rollback Procedure (2-3 hours)

#### Step 1: Pause Recent Changes

**Immediate Actions:**
```
1. Log into Amazon Ads Console
2. Navigate to: Campaign Manager
3. Filter by: "Recently Modified" (last 7 days)
4. Review each changed campaign/keyword
5. Revert to previous settings OR pause entirely
```

**Priority Order:**
1. Pause any new campaigns launched in last 7 days
2. Reduce increased budgets back to previous levels
3. Revert bid changes (undo increases)
4. Review day-of-week adjustments

---

#### Step 2: Re-Enable Paused Winners (If Needed)

**If rollback requires more spend:**
```
1. Review what was paused in Week 1
2. Evaluate if any should be re-enabled:
   - SmokeXtractor campaigns (probably not)
   - Roller Kit Tray Auto (probably not)
   - Targeting expressions (probably not)
3. If re-enabling, do so at 50% previous budget
4. Monitor for 48 hours before full restoration
```

---

#### Step 3: Root Cause Analysis

**Why Did Performance Decline?**

**Check These Factors:**
```
☐ Product stockouts/unavailability
☐ Competitor price changes (are we priced too high?)
☐ Seasonal demand shifts
☐ Listing changes (did you update anything?)
☐ Reviews declined (negative review spike?)
☐ Amazon algorithm changes
☐ Budget changes were too aggressive
☐ External factors (holiday, events)
```

**Data to Pull:**
```
1. Product page traffic and CVR (last 14 days vs previous 14)
2. Competitor pricing (manual check or tool)
3. Review score changes
4. Search ranking changes (did you drop?)
5. Advertising cost changes (did CPCs spike?)
```

---

#### Step 4: Create Recovery Plan

**If Issue is External (not your changes):**
- Maintain current setup
- Monitor daily
- Wait for market conditions to stabilize

**If Issue is Internal (your changes):**
- Revert to baseline completely
- Wait 5-7 days for performance to stabilize
- Restart optimization more conservatively:
  - Week 1: Only pause waste (don't reallocate)
  - Week 2: Small budget increases (10% vs 50%)
  - Week 3: Evaluate and proceed carefully
