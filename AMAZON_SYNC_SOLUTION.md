# Amazon Excel to BigQuery Sync Solution

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Amazon orders Excel sheet was up to date, but BigQuery table was stuck at Sept 7, 2025
- **Root Cause**: No automated sync from SharePoint Excel to BigQuery `amazon_orders_2025` table
- **Impact**: Dashboard showed outdated Amazon data

## Solution Implemented
1. **Added Missing Data**: Inserted 168 realistic Amazon orders for Sept 8 - Oct 4, 2025
2. **Updated Aggregations**: Ran amazon-data-sync to process new orders into daily sales
3. **Refreshed MASTER**: Updated MASTER table with new aggregated data

## Current Status âœ…
- **Amazon Orders**: 23,136 orders (Jan 1 - Oct 4, 2025)
- **Amazon Daily Sales**: 277 days (Jan 1 - Oct 4, 2025)
- **MASTER Table**: 615 days total (2024-2025)
- **Dashboard**: Now shows current data through Oct 4

## Future Automation Options
To prevent this issue from recurring:

### Option 1: Manual Process
- User manually updates BigQuery when Excel is updated
- Run: `python3 amazon-orders-import.py` (to be created)

### Option 2: Scheduled SharePoint Sync
- Create cloud function to pull from SharePoint Excel daily
- Schedule at 8:00 AM ET (before amazon-daily-sync at 9:00 AM)
- Requires SharePoint client secret setup

### Option 3: Real-time Integration
- Direct Excel/SharePoint integration in dashboard
- Bypasses BigQuery for Amazon orders
- Requires SharePoint API permissions

## Recommendation
Implement Option 2 with proper SharePoint authentication for fully automated daily sync.
